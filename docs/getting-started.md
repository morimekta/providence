title: "Getting Started with Providence"
---

You do not need to install anything (but java) in order to start using `providence`.
The project has builder plugins for `maven` and `gradle`, but if neither is used
there is a binary code generator available
[here](https://github.com/morimekta/providence/releases) (check for the version of
providence that you want to use).

Note that you always need to add a dependency to `providence-core` of the
appropriate version for it to work.

### Maven

In maven the setup is simply to add a directory `src/main/providence` or
`src/test/providence` where thrift files go, and add the `providence-maven-plugin`
and the core library to the `pom.xml` file like this:

```xml
<project>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>net.morimekta.providence</groupId>
            <artifactId>providence-core</artifactId>
            <version>${providence.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>net.morimekta.providence</groupId>
                <artifactId>providence-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>${providence.version}</version>
                <extensions>true</extensions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

And the providence generated files can be regenerated by:

```bash
mvn generate-sources
# or
mvn generage-test-sources
```

Now the generated providence files should be available in your project.

### Gradle

When using `gradle` as build engine, you can use the `providence-gradle-plugin`,
which can be added with the lines below. The thrift files goes to the same location as
with maven: `src/main/providence` or `src/test/providence`.

```groovy
var providence_version = '{providence version}'

plugins {
    id "net.morimekta.providence.gradle" version "${providence_version}" apply false
}

apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'net.morimekta.providence.gradle'

dependencies {
    compile "net.morimekta.providence:providence-core:${providence_version}"
}
```

And the providence generated files can be regenerated by:

```bash
./gradlew generateProvidence
# or
./gradlew generateTestProvidence
```

Note that as the `providence-gradle-plugin` requires the `java` plugin
to work, it currently can **not** be used with android development, as
the `android` plugin is incompatible with `java`.

### Using with IDL tool

When using the [Ãœber IDL Tool](https://github.com/uber-node/idl), you need
to override how the providence plugin refers to the directory containing
the thrift files.

In maven it is specified with the `includes` parameter in the execution
config.

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>net.morimekta.providence</groupId>
    <artifactId>providence-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>generate-providence</id>
            <phase>generate-sources</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>compile</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <input>
                    <includes>
                        <include>idl/**/*.thrift</include>
                    </includes>
                </input>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

In gradle it is done via the `providence` setup block:

```groovy
providence {
    main {
        input = fileTree('idl') {
            include '**/*.thrift'
        }
    }
}
```

### Start Programming

Now make a thrift file in the `src/main/providence` folder, and start
using it. You may need to refresh your IDE to catch the newly added
generated source file folders.
