The stages done to make a release.

### Making a SNAPSHOT release

Snapshot releases can be made directly from the `master` branch.

* Run `# mvn clean deploy` from master at the desired commit.

### Making a version release

Proper releases are done with a branch cut.

#### Check for dependency updates

Run the maven versions plugin to see what has been updated of dependencies and
plugins. See if updates should be done. Usually it's better to depend on
newer versions, as you may drag in older versions into other projects that
misses features or has specific bugs.

```bash
mvn -Pall versions:display-dependency-updates
mvn -Pall versions:display-plugin-updates
```

#### Making the release cut.

```bash
# Do the maven release:
mvn -Pall release:prepare
mvn -Plib release:perform
mvn -Pall release:clean
git fetch origin
```

If the artifacts found at the [Nexus Repository Manager](https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories)
are correct, you're ready to make the release. If not a git hard rollback is needed (to remove release
version, tag and commits). First make the actual binary release:

```bash
# And upload these files to github release, then upload to bintray with:
./upload-bintray.sh
# And follow links to publish new artifacts.
```

Then update and release the gradle plugin. You may need to wait 20+ minutes for
the maven indices to be updates with the providence release before you can do this
step:

* Go to `providence-gradle-plugin` repository.
* Update version in `gradle.properties` and in the `README.md` file.

```bash
# in the providence-gradle-plugin repository:
./gradlew clean test publishPlugins
```

Now the release is complete.
